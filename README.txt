This program lets you track how you spend your time.

You put a marker down at different points in the day when you start something or accomplish something (or any time in between). This will help you later estimate how much time you spend on your activities. You can be as precise as you want to be; this tool just helps you by giving you a little reminder of what you did at around that time.
